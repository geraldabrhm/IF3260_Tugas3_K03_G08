## General Information
3D WebGL Articulated Model is a website that contains four 3D articulated models which are xx, xx, xx, and xx that is created to simulate transormation and projection on the articulated models. It is created using WebGL without any kind of libraries or frameworks. This website consists of several buttons, sliders, and input fields to carry out commands and run existing features. It also has a canvas where user models are drawn and modified. Some of the functionalities it has are object transformation (translation, rotation, scaling), projection (orthographic, oblique, perspective), camera view changes (angle and zoom in/out), reset, shading, texture mapping, animation, and save/load file.


## Technologies Used
The program was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


## Setup
### Prerequisite
- A browser which supports WebGL, HTML5, and JavaScript

### Execution
1. Clone this repository in your own local directory

    `git clone https://github.com/geraldabrhm/IF3260_Tugas3_K03_G08.git`

2. Open the 'index.html' file for image mapping and '.html' for bum mapping which located in 'src' folder and run in your browser

3. Or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code to avoid cross origin error in loading the texture


## Usage
(undone)
The 3D WebGL Hollow Object was made using an interface whose input and output can be directly done in the browser. The features in the interface include:
1. Bentuk: to define which object will change/move when another feature in web is used
2. Proyeksi: to select the projection type
3. Rotasi: to rotate the object according to the selected axis 
4. Translasi: to shift objects left/right/up/down
5. Scaling: to zoom in or zoom out selected object based on the scale input
6. Angle: to set the horizontal and vertical camera angle
7. Zoom In and Zoom Out: to zoom in or zoom out the camera view which affects to the size of the objects
8. Shading: to gives color shading to objects
9. Save and Load: to save and load file
10. Reset: to return objects to their default settings


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_

All the specifications were implemented.


## Room for Improvement
- A faster or more efficient algorithm to make the program run quicker
- A better interface design to satisfy the users
